    class KCL
      # Create a new consumer that consumes data from a Kinesis stream using the
      # AWS Kinesis Client Library.
      #
      # The KCL uses DynamoDB to register clients as part of the an application
      # and evenly distribute work between all of the clients registered for
      # the same application. See the AWS Docs for more information:
      #
      # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-consumer-apps-with-kcl.html
      #
      # KCLs are configured with a hash. The Kinesis `:stream` to consume from
      # is required.
      #
      # KCL clients operate in groups. All consumers with the same `:app` id use
      # DynamoDB to attempt to distribute work evenly among themselves. The
      # `:worker_id` is used to distinguish individual clients (`:worker_id`
      # defaults to the current hostname. If you plan to run more than one KCL
      # client in the same `:app` on the same host, make sure you set this to
      # something unique!).
      #
      # Any other valid KCL Worker `:options` may be passed as a nested hash.
      #
      # For example, to configure a `tail` app on `some-stream` and use the
      # default `:worker_id`, you might pass the following configuration to your
      # KCL.
      #
      #     config = {
      #       app: 'tail',
      #       stream: 'some-stream',
      #       options: {initial_position_in_stream: 'TRIM_HORIZON'}
      #     }
      #
      # To actually process the stream, a KCL client creates record processors.
      # These are objects that correspond to the KCL's RecordProcessor
      # interface - processors must implement `init`, `process_records`, and
      # `shutdown` methods.
      #
      # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-record-processor-implementation-app-java.html#kcl-java-interface-v2
      #
      # To specify which record processor to create, pass a block to your
      # distribtued consumer that returns a new record processor. This block
      # may (nay, WILL) be called from a background thread so make sure that
      # it's thread-safe.
      #
      # Telekinesis provides a BaseProcessor that implements no-op versions
      # of all of the required methods to make writing quick processors easier
      # and a Block processor that executes the given block every time
      # `process_records` is called.
      #
      # To write a simple stream tailer, you might use Block as follows:
      #
      #     kcl_worker = Telekinesis::Consumer::KCL.new(config, true) do
      #       Telekinesis::Consumer::BlockProcessor.new do |records, checkpointer, millis_behind_latest|
      #         records.each{|r| puts r}
      #         $stderr.puts "#{millis_behind_latest} ms behind"
      #         checkpointer.checkpoint
      #       end
      #     end
      #
      #     kcl_worker.run
      #
      # In case you would like to turn multi-threading off, you can set second param after config to be false
      # Default is true if it isn't passed.
      def initialize(config, multithread = true, &block)
        raise ArgumentError, "No block given!" unless block_given?
        kcl_config = self.class.build_config(config)

      # Start the KCL worker. If background is set to `true`, the worker is
      # started in its own JRuby Thread and the Thread is returned. Otherwise,
      # starts in the current thread and returns nil.
